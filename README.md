This is a 5-week pilot pythonic (mostly) project to build a predictive modeling (29/7- 3/9/2019). We hope to raise awareness of the youth community through social media about climate change at Son Tra Peninsula at Danang.

**Timeline:**
- Sprint 1 (29/7 - 11/8): Setting up and kicking-off.
- Sprint 2 (12-8 - 26/8): Implementation with basic features.
- Sprint 3 (26/8 - 3/9): Advance Implementation.

More details can be tracked through our public [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/DL7gE5bb/xlabfl-forrestsee)
